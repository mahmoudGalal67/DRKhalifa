          Application of Inspecta-Shield flame retardant is via spray method at
          a maximum of 15 p.s.i.. Pressures higher than 25 p.s.i. have been
          found to destroy textile fibers. To ensure proper penetration, the
          flame retardant solution contains a wetting agent to carry the flame
          retardant compounds into the textile fibers.
